## Workshop Overview

This page focuses on the _Girls Who Build: Make Your Own Wearables Workshop_ as it was facilitated by Kristen Railey in December 2014.

The _Make Your Own Wearables_ _Workshop_ introduces high school girls to computer science and electrical and mechanical engineering through wearable technology. This one-day workshop, developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, consists of hands-on projects in manufacturing and wearable electronics. These include 3D printing jewelry and laser cutting a purse, as well as programming LEDs to light up when walking. Participants learn the design process, 3D computer modeling, and about machine shop tools, in addition to writing code and building a circuit.

## Intended Workshop Outcomes

### Workshop Goals for Participants

- Discover what engineering is
- Challenge stereotypes about who engineers are and what they do
- Gain exposure to the design process
- Explore 3D computer modeling
- Design a bracelet using {{% resource_link "ae226c21-bcf5-4371-80b6-22a9835e5d96" "SOLIDWORKS" %}}
- Code a {{% resource_link "01bd73fd-ae85-40a9-a507-475e429b5a82" "FLORA" %}} in Arduino for a wearable circuit with pressure sensor and LEDs
- Tour a rapid prototyping machine shop
